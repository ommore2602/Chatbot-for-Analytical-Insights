# Chatbot for Analytical Insights

* This project implements a Chatbot that assists with analytical insights for datasets. The chatbot leverages natural language processing (NLP) techniques to answer questions, perform analyses, and generate visual insights based on user queries.

# Project Overview
* The project aims to help users interact with a dataset by querying a chatbot for specific analytical insights, including descriptive statistics, visualizations, and predictive models. The chatbot responds in real-time with answers, plots, and summaries to assist with data-driven decision-making.

# Key Features:
* Natural Language Interaction: Users can ask questions about the dataset in natural language, and the chatbot will respond with relevant analysis.
* Data Insights: The chatbot provides both descriptive and predictive analyses, including statistical summaries, visualizations, and forecasts.
* Interactive Visualizations: Plots and charts are generated dynamically in response to user queries, using Python visualization libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, or Plotly.
# Getting Started
* Prerequisites
* Ensure that Python 3.x is installed, along with the following libraries:

pandas

numpy

matplotlib

seaborn

plotly

scikit-learn

nltk

transformers (for NLP)

dash (for web-based interactive dashboard)
